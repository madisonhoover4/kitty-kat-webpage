<h1>Cats with Food</h1>

<h2>A Harmonious Relationship</h2>
<p> Cats and food have a long loving relationship, much like myself and food, and they are often seen devouring food not made for their kind. Let's be honest though, if we had to eat the kibble they are served, we would not be happy either.</p>
